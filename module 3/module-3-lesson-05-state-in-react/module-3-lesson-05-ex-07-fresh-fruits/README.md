# Exercise 7

### Fresh Fruits
Let's make a list of popular fruits, allowing us to add and remove items.
```javascript
this.state = {
  popularFruits: ['kiwi', 'pinneaple', 'strawberry'],
  newFruit: ''
};
```
1. Paint the list from the `popularFruits` status key.
2. Paint a text input and a button with the text "Add".
3. Each time the input changes, the `newFruit` status key must be updated.
